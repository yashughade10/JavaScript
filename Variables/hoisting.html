        Hoisting : 
        Hoisting is a concept in JavaScript where all variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared, and it will still work.
     -->

     <script>
        // Hoisting only possible in var 
        console.log(x);      
        var x=10;
        
        // Hoisting not possible in let and const 
        console.log(y);
        console.log(z);
        let y=10;
        const z=10;
